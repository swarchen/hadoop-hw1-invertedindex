Automation is eating the world

Here’s the problem: Industrialism consumes itself. As an example: Every time a line of software is written, a job is lost.

Software increases automation, which removes the need for a worker.

Think of all the innovations happening and what they replace:

Artificial intelligence removes the need for thinkers of basic jobs (and later…more advanced jobs).
3D printing removes the need for construction and many manufacturing jobs.
Virtual reality is going to be a trillion-dollar industry that removes the ultimate middleman…air and distance.
Robotics removes the need for much manual labor. Walmart shelves are already being stocked by robots and not humans.
And on and on. Autonomous cars remove the need for drivers and will eventually replace public transportation.
